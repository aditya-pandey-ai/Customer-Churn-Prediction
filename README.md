## üß† Overview

Customer churn ‚Äî when a customer stops using a company‚Äôs service ‚Äî is a major concern across industries like telecom, banking, and e-commerce. This project uses a deep learning model (Artificial Neural Network) to predict customer churn based on historical data, enabling businesses to retain customers with timely interventions.
